  <h1>Lobsters HTTP 502 status: server error</h1>
  <p>
    nginx tried to pass your request to puma but failed.
    This probably means we're in the middle of a deploy.

  May 2024: We are seeing oomkills about twice daily because of a memory leak.
  I'm sorry, I know it's irritating, but I don't have the attention to debug it
  until after RailsConf May 7-9. If you have experience tracing Rails memory
  leaks, let me know, because I'm new to it. Unfortunately,
  <a href="https://github.com/lobsters/lobsters/commit/cc2deddeb2f7f441b4dd417571b73161f3c0c49c">it wasn't Ruby bug 20209</a>.
